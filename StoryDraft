You fell asleep while writing articles criticising the 
trimester system. When you wake up, you see yourself in a
dungeon. Inside the dungeon lies the most fearsome monster
Trimestaurus. This monster has shape resembling the 
nonexistent creature called giraffe(r/Giraffesdontexist) 
and it roars like a kazoo. You must fight your way through 
the dungeon and defeat Trimestaurus, or you'll keep sleeping 
and your coffee will get cold.
